GTother Auto-Script
-------------------

Edit this file to include your GT username and password (will be in plaintext on your computer, but will authenticate through https).
Then stick the file in the folder:

```
/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d
```

Now, if you use NetworkManager, you will be logged in to GTother auto-magically!

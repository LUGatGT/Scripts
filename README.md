Random BASH Scripts, Utilities, and Other Stuff

If you are adding a script to this directory please include
a comment explaining how to use your script / what is does
either in the top of the file or in a readme.


Most scripts that you will write should go in the hacks directory.
This is the directory for fun little programs that are generally useless.
If you write something that is a little more useful then it may belong in
the misc directory.

Please don't have spaces in files or directory names that you create.
